# Matchup Analyzer

Data-driven matchup breakdowns for NBA, MLB, and Soccer. Compares teams
and players head-to-head with stats, trends, and key factors.

## What It Does

- Produces structured matchup reports for any two teams or players
- Pulls stats from multiple sources for comprehensive analysis
- Identifies strengths, weaknesses, and key matchup factors
- Shows historical head-to-head records where available
- Highlights trending players and situational advantages
- Outputs clean markdown matchup cards

## How It Works

1. You provide two teams (or players) and the sport
2. The analyzer pulls today's schedule and live context for game-day matchups
3. Team and player stats are fetched from sport-specific APIs
4. Stats are compared across key categories with advantage indicators
5. A structured matchup card is generated with insights and edge factors
